# Swift ImageSlideShow for iOS
ImageSlideShow is a simple Slideshow for images (Picture, Photos) for your iOS apps written in Swift 5.
You can use this class on iPhone and iPad as well.

## Features
- All in one slideshow with generic protocol to provide images directly from the model
- Pan-gesture-to-dismiss behaviour (like Facebook)

## Installation with CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Objective-C, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries like ImageSlideShow in your projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

> CocoaPods 1.0.1+ is required to build ImageSlideShow (along with Swift 5 and Xcode 10).

#### Podfile

To integrate ImageSlideShow into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '9.0'

target 'TargetName' do
  use_frameworks!
  pod 'ImageSlideShowSwift'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

## Installation with Carthage
Currently only iOS is supported.

1. Add the following to your [Cartfile](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/Documentation/Artifacts.md#cartfile):

    ```
    github "dimix/ImageSlideShow"
    ```

2. Run `carthage update --platform ios`

3. Copy the framework into your project and you are good to go.

## How to Use

#### 1. Import ImageSlideShowSwift module

```swift
Import ImageSlideShowSwift
```

ImageSlideShowSwift
#### 2. Instantiate the controller

```swift
ImageSlideShowViewController.presentFrom(self){ [weak self] controller in
			
	controller.dismissOnPanGesture = true
	controller.slides = self?.images
	controller.enableZoom = true
	controller.controllerDidDismiss = {
		print("Controller Dismissed")
	}
			
}
```

You need to provide an array of `[ImageSlideShowProtocol]` objects.
You can use the Demo project to watch details.
